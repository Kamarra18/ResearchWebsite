        <td>AI is transforming the agriculture industry, and it is expected to take off in 2025. Early adopters started with simple data analytics tools, but now full-blown AI systems can manage entire farms</td>
        <td>Agricultural engineering was introduced by H. M. Lynde and F. R. Baker in 1913-141. The American Society of Agricultural Engineers, now known as the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE), was founded in 1907</td>
        <td>innovations in agricultural engineering which 
            changed agriculture at their time or at least provided significant progress in this field are presented here. If one traces back the mechanization of agriculture along the milestones of agricultural engineering 25, 50, 75 years, and longer, one will notice with astonishment that many 
            ideas and solution proposals are not as new as they seem</td>
        <td>Autonomous Agriculture, Precision Farming & Robotics began in the 1980s. The concept of precision agriculture was theorized by Dr. Pierre Robert, who pioneered precision farming principles1. The development of robotics in agriculture dates back to the 1920s, with research on automatic vehicle guidance leading to autonomous agricultural vehicles in the 1950s and 60s</td>
